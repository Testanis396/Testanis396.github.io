# Introduction
Hello! My name is Tomas Estanislao, and this is my final Capstone project for my BSCS. 

I transferred to Southern New Hampshire University around one year ago, in order to affordably finish my degree online. Through my coursework in this program, I have gained numerous technical and soft skillsâ€” and have been exposed to various CS domains.   

I will briefly cover a few topics that will highlight skills that I have gained throughout my coursework. 

## Collaboration
There are two things that immediately come to mind when thinking about collaboration: version control and methodology. When it comes to physically writing code, developing and testing, using git effectively is crucial. I was able to work with git in CS465 and practice using branches and frequent committing to stay organized.

In CS250, I learned about different software development methodologies and practiced the roles within an agile team. I also researched different collaborative tools, such as _Gherkin_, which was illuminating.

## Communication

In terms of communication, I have practiced system design, diagramming, and presentations. CS255 was an interesting class where I learned not only how to analyze systems, but also how to graphically illustrate them in meaningful ways. These two skills combine to provide powerful tools for communicating with stakeholders.

## Data Structures/Algorithms

In CS320, I created custom classes and services for: Contacts, Tasks, and Appointments. I designed these data structures in addition to JUnit tests. I focused on the functional requirements, using: automated, regression, boundary, and negative testing. Code coverage was a tool that I had heard about, but never understood. I used coverage to ensure that all branches were being appropriately accessed and tested as well.

## Software Engineering/Databases

I am proud of my work in CS330 to create a 3d scene. I was able to demonstrate my skills with a lower level language, while also leveraging my math background to implement low-poly shapes. I used formulaes to manually create circles with over twenty vertices, properly connecting and shading, resulting in objects such as: Spheres, Toruses, Cylinders, and Hexagonol/Rectagonal Prisms. My Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus background was especially helpful in dealing with vectors.

In CS340 I interacted with MongoDB for the first time, building an interative dashboard to visualize data. I was impressed by how easy it was to set up these tools and frameworks, while also excited to create custom queries and practice some UI/UX skills. This was one of the first projects where I considered pursuing a career and further education dealing with data.
