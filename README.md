# Introduction
Hello! My name is Tomas Estanislao, and this is my final Capstone project for my BSCS. 

I transferred to Southern New Hampshire University around one year ago, in order to affordably finish my degree online. Through my coursework in this program, I have gained numerous technical and soft skillsâ€” and have been exposed to various CS domains.   

I will briefly cover a few topics that will highlight skills that I have gained throughout my coursework. 

## Collaboration
There are two things that immediately come to mind when thinking about collaboration: version control and documentation. When it comes to physically writing code, developing and testing, using git effectively is crucial. I was able to work with git in CS465 and practice using branches and frequent committing to stay organized.
