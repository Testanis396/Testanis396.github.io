# Introduction
Hello! My name is Tomas Estanislao, and this is my final Capstone project for my BSCS. 

I transferred to Southern New Hampshire University around one year ago, in order to affordably finish my degree online. Through my coursework in this program, I have gained numerous technical and soft skillsâ€” and have been exposed to various CS domains.   

I will briefly cover a few topics that will highlight skills that I have gained throughout my coursework. 

## Collaboration
There are two things that immediately come to mind when thinking about collaboration: version control and documentation.

In terms of documentation, I have practiced system design and diagramming. CS255 sticks out as 

## Communication

In terms of communication, I have practiced system design, diagramming, and presentations. CS255 was an interesting class where I learned not only how to analyze systems, but also how to graphically illustrate them in meaningful ways. These two skills combine to provide powerful tools for communicating with stakeholders.
